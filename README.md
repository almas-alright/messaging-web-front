# Messaging Web Front

Simple chat frontend for the reusable messaging backend service.

This repository is **frontend only**.

Backend repository:

```text
https://github.com/almas-alright/messaging-service
```

## Goal

Build a simple WhatsApp-like chat UI that can run on your Ubuntu PC and connect to the local messaging backend through configurable URLs.

Standalone local chat:

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Configurable backend API base URL
- Configurable WebSocket URL
- Email/password registration and login through the messaging backend
- Messaging access/refresh token session lifecycle
- Authenticated contacts and one-to-one conversations
- Message list
- Emoji support
- File upload/send
- Attachment preview/link
- Local network testing from other computers

Future direction:

- Embeddable chat widget like tawk.to
- Website iframe/script integration
- Compact floating chat window
- Voice message sending
- Optional AI bot per chat side
- Human takeover from AI bot

## Not In This Frontend

- Full marketplace frontend
- AI bot implementation
- Voice messages
- tawk.to-style embed script
- Agent dashboard

Those are future phases.

## Local Installation Plan

Both backend and frontend can run on the same Ubuntu PC.

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- Docker with Docker Compose
- Running messaging backend on port `8080`

Backend example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/almas-alright/messaging-service.git
cd messaging-service
docker compose up --build
```

Frontend local run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/almas-alright/messaging-web-front.git
cd messaging-web-front
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

The app defaults to:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

Google and GitHub buttons remain provider hooks until their public client IDs
and browser authorization adapters are configured. Client secrets must never be
added to frontend environment files.

For LAN testing, create a local `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.10:8080
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://192.168.1.10:8080/ws
```

Use your Ubuntu PC LAN IP instead of `192.168.1.10`.

Other computers on the same local network can open:

```text
http://192.168.1.10:5173
```

## Local Network Demo Guide

Use this when the backend and frontend run on one Ubuntu PC and other devices
on the same Wi-Fi/LAN need to test the chat.

1. Find the Ubuntu PC LAN IP:

```bash
hostname -I
```

Use the first address that matches your local network, for example
`192.168.1.10` or `10.10.33.97`.

2. Start the backend from the backend repository:

```bash
cd ../messaging-service
docker compose up --build
```

Backend URLs should be reachable from the Ubuntu PC:

```text
http://<host-ip>:8080/health
http://<host-ip>:8080/ready
```

3. Configure the frontend for LAN access.

Create `.env.local` in this repository:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://<host-ip>:8080
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://<host-ip>:8080/ws
```

4. Start the frontend dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

Open from the Ubuntu PC:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Open from another device on the same network:

```text
http://<host-ip>:5173
```

5. Authenticated chat flow:

- Register two accounts in separate browser sessions, or sign in to two existing accounts.
- Search for the other user by email or username and add them as a contact.
- Select the contact to resolve the direct conversation and connect live chat.
- Confirm message history loads, then send text and file messages.
- Confirm delivered/seen receipts update in both browser sessions.

The main app is served at `/`. The legacy developer demo remains available at
`/demo` for reference only.

Make sure firewall rules allow inbound traffic to ports `5173` and `8080` on
the Ubuntu PC during local testing.

For a repeatable walkthrough, use
[docs/local-test-checklist.md](docs/local-test-checklist.md).

For frontend/backend ownership details, see
[docs/config-boundary.md](docs/config-boundary.md).

Release notes are in [docs/release-notes.md](docs/release-notes.md).

## Frontend Checks

Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

`npm run lint` is not configured yet.

## Docker Static Frontend

Build and run the frontend as a static Nginx container:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

For LAN demo builds, pass the backend URLs at build time:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://<host-ip>:8080 \
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://<host-ip>:8080/ws \
FRONTEND_PORT=5173 \
docker compose up --build
```

Vite embeds these values during the Docker image build.

## Backend CORS Requirement

The backend must allow local frontend origins during LAN testing, for example:

```text
http://localhost:5173
http://127.0.0.1:5173
http://192.168.1.10:5173
```

For production, CORS should be restricted to approved domains only.

## Agent Workflow

Start from:

```text
AGENTS.md
.agent/CURRENT_PLAN.md
<active-plan>/TASKS.md
```

Rules:

- One plan = one branch
- One task = one commit
- Stop after each task
- Keep this repository frontend-only
